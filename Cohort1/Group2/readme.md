Hello Cohort1 Group2, you can add your scripts here!

2024-02-27 notes:
Looks like we'll be doing some data analysis with Python!
- Use pandas library in python
- Analyze CSV and/or JSON files from this link: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/zynicide/wine-reviews

- Also, Harland plans to pass along scripts used in digital preservation workflows when ready! Group to check these out as a resource for everyday application of Python.

Description of the course I found: We often are told ‘learn to code’ but not given a clear purpose or direction to realize this goal. This is especially true for workers in the Library field. This course will attempt to address this challenge by providing a great introduction to data science aimed at all learners. Participants will be introduced to the Python programming language and how it can be used to analyize data. This includes organizing and writing code in Jupyter Notebooks, manipulating data with the Pandas, visualizing data with the Matplotlib, and making predictions with data using the scikit-learn library. No previous programming experience is required or expected. Exercises will be drawn from topics that resonate with the daily work of Librarians and those in related fields. For example, participants will learn how to analyze a quantity of Sci Hub usage data, and will examine DOI data harvested from the Crossref API.
